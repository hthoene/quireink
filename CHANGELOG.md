# Changelog

What changes from one release of QuireInk to the next. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org); before 1.0, a minor version may
change the plugin SDK.

## [Unreleased]

- Smaller text by default: menus 9 pt (was 11), status lines 6 pt
  (was 8). Both stay adjustable in the settings.
- Dictionary: the page of a long entry no longer covers *Online*.
- Text and paper colours on Android (Appearance): eight of each, or
  one's own colour code (e.g. #5b4636); night mode swaps them.
- The folder chooser says when it is still opening a folder (slow SD
  cards) and ignores taps until it shows it.
- Widgets have settings of their own, from the home screen's editor:
  where the status line, date, clock, today's reading and the word of
  the day sit (left, centre, right), and whether the clock shows the
  date. Plugins give their widgets settings the same way
  (`widgets::settings_group`, `widgets::align_setting`).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-15

The Android app for F-Droid.

- The app is built reproducibly: with the same tools (shells/android/
  versions.env) it comes out byte for byte the same anywhere, so F-Droid
  can publish it signed with QuireInk's key. A dependency's macro that
  wrote its code in a random order is patched (patches/jni-macros).
- The app's library is stored in the APK and runs from there, without
  symbols: 6.8 MB to download, less space taken on the device.
- The licence names the copyright holder; README with screenshots.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-15

The first release: QuireInk on Android e-readers (tested on a Boox Go 7)
and in the desktop emulator, with its plugin SDK. The firmware for the
Xteink X4 is built but has not run on a device yet.

### Reading

- EPUB 2 and 3 (with the book's styles, embedded fonts and pictures, or
  one's own stylesheets per folder or book), FB2, Markdown, plain text,
  comic archives (CBZ), Xteink's XTC and XTCH, and PDF on Android.
- Contents, search, bookmarks and highlights with notes, export of notes
  as Markdown, a dictionary (StarDict), Wikipedia and translation
  (DeepL), a vocabulary list of words looked up.
- Hyphenation (German, English), reading fonts with weight and size,
  margins, spacing, status lines to taste, reading aloud, pages turned
  by themselves, turning the screen.
- Reading statistics, shared with KOReader (also over WebDAV), and
  reading positions synced with KOReader's sync server.

### Books and more

- A home screen of widgets on pages (date, battery, continue reading,
  recently read, tools, statistics, headlines), editable by touch or
  buttons.
- The library by folders, authors, series and tags; a file manager;
  books from OPDS catalogs and WebDAV folders (Nextcloud), kept in sync.
- News feeds as books; Wallabag's read-later articles, highlights to
  Readwise and a browser, switched off until wanted; transfers from a
  computer or phone over Wi-Fi, typing on a phone.
- A sleep screen (cover, picture or widgets), screenshots.

### Making it one's own

- Every screen, menu, key and gesture can be changed, in the app or in
  `quireink.ini`; profiles, rules, themes, translations and fonts as
  plugins without code (data plugins).
- Settings with descriptions and a search, passwords and keys in one
  place, short menus by default, usable by touch and by buttons alike.
- English and German.

### For developers

- The plugin SDK (`quireink-sdk`) with a guide ([Writing
  plugins](docs/plugins.md)) and a sample plugin; plugins are tested
  against the real kernel.
- The desktop emulator with device profiles and memory budgets.
- The Xteink X4's firmware, its display, buttons, battery and SD card
  tested against simulated hardware ([ADR 0013](docs/adr/0013-x4-firmware.md)).
